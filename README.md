**Project: Trends and Predictions in Software Technologies**
**Tools:** IBM Cognos Analytics, Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib), Jupyter Notebook

* Spearheaded a data analytics project focused on identifying current trends and forecasting future developments in software technologies, with a specific focus on programming language popularity and adoption patterns.
* Collected and integrated data from multiple sources, performing extensive data cleaning, transformation, and validation to ensure high data quality and consistency across the dataset.
* Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python libraries such as Pandas and Matplotlib to uncover key patterns, technology usage cycles, and emerging shifts in developer preferences.
* Applied statistical techniques and time series forecasting models to predict future trends in programming language usage and software development frameworks.
* Designed and built interactive dashboards and visual reports in IBM Cognos Analytics to present findings in a clear, accessible format for both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
* Delivered actionable insights to support long-term strategic planning, helping decision-makers stay ahead of technology trends and align resource allocation with anticipated shifts in the software landscape.
